/*[LEARNT] - In C++ if an object is const, then it is totally CONSTANT, not like Java, where we can change contents of object, even with const reference -
* In C++, 'const' is like a promise to be kept, but can be broken using pointers sometimes, as needed
    const Class* n;   //Can't change the 'content' of what the pointer points to (ie. members 'shouldn't' be modified), but can make it point to a different location
    Class const* n; //Same as above, just the astericks is at different position

    Class* const n; //Java like, Can modfify the content, but can't make it point to something else
    const Class* const n;   //TOTALLY Constant by every mean
